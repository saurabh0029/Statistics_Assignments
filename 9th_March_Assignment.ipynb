    "Let's consider the roll of a fair six-sided die. The possible outcomes are the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and \n",

    "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics that describes the behavior of the sample mean of a large\n",

    "In other words, when we take a large number of samples from a population and calculate the means of those samples, the distribution \n",

    "The significance of the Central Limit Theorem is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "(i).Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The CLT tells us that as the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution,\n",
    "    regardless of the shape of the original population distribution. This is true even if the population distribution is not normal.\n",

    "(ii)Population Parameter Estimation: \n",

    "    The CLT enables us to estimate population parameters, such as the population mean, with greater accuracy. By calculating the sample \n",

    "\n",
    "(iii)Hypothesis Testing: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The CLT is the basis for many hypothesis tests that assume a normal distribution for the sample mean. When the sample size is\n",
    "    sufficiently large, we can use z-tests or t-tests, which rely on the properties of the normal distribution, to make statistical \n",
    "    inferences about population parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iv)Practical Application: \n",

    "    The CLT is widely used in various fields, including quality control, economics, social sciences, and medical research. It allows\n",

    "The key assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem are as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "1.Independence: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The individual observations in the sample must be independent of each other. In other words, the value of one observation should\n",
    "    not be influenced by or dependent on the values of other observations in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Identically Distributed: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The sample observations should be drawn from the same underlying population and follow the same probability distribution. This \n",
    "    means that the mean and variance of the population should be finite.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Random Sampling:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The samples should be selected randomly from the population, without any bias or systematic preference. Random sampling ensures\n",
    "    that the sample is representative of the population and helps to reduce potential sampling errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Finite Variance: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The population from which the samples are drawn must have a finite variance (i.e., the variance of the population is not infinite).\n",
